<h1>Welcome</h1>
<p>Please use the code with caution, it's not complete and expect some bugs, but overall it works and I daily drive it. 
Currently I tested and use update, start, stop, and check commands</p>
<br>
<h2>Setup config.ini</h2>
<p>Inside config.ini you need to specifi your Paper server Full Directory and name it. Look at example below.</p>
<p>SERVER - stores the server name</p>
<p>SERVER_DIR - stores the server directory</p>

```
SERVER=("lobby" "survival" "creative")
SERVER_DIR=("/home/username/Mine-Server/lobby/" "/home/username/Mine-Server/survival/" "/home/username/Mine-Server/creative/")
```
